# Rename sequences 3.0
Compared to the Rename sequence 2.0 : 
    Now all the code has been defined as a function "Rename_seq", you can use this function to change the name in the fasta file, and when the file is successfully exported, your IDE will return the string 'The name part you wanted to change has been finished'.
How to use :
    You can use print (Rename_seq(Your_list = [])) to complete it.
    Your list should include your fasta file names and the rename character.(You should input the rename character to the last)
